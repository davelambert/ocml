This is OCML, the Operational Conceptual Modelling Language.  OCML
combines logical reasoning in a frame-based language with the
flexibility of extra-logical facilities like procedural attachment.

OCML was originally conceived, designed, and implemented by Enrico
Motta.

It is implemented in Common Lisp, and has been tested with Lispworks,
SBCL, and Allegro implementations.
